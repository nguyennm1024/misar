## 📖 Abstract
Augmented reality (AR) presents us with a world where the boundaries between the real and the digital blur. But to make this seamless, there's a need to effectively merge various input channels such as visual, auditory, and linguistic for an optimized human-computer interaction. While we've made strides in auditory and visual domains, the huge potential of large language models (LLMs) in AR is still waiting to be fully unlocked. 

MISAR is our attempt to bridge this gap. We introduce an avant-garde methodology that leverages the power of LLMs to interpret and process information from visual, auditory, and contextual dimensions. Our focus has been on addressing the challenge of task performance measurement in AR. This led us to the incorporation of egocentric video analytics, nuanced speech processing, and meticulous context examination. By integrating LLMs, we've managed to considerably elevate state estimation, pushing the boundaries of what AR systems can achieve in terms of adaptiveness.
